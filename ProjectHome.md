# Pure Uploader #

Pure Uploader is a jQuery plugin that provides HTML5 upload capabilities for modern browsers, and limited multiple upload functionality for older browsers.

Currently tested with IE6, FF3.6, Opera 10, Chrome 5.

For browsers that support HTML5 uploads via `XMLHttpRequest`s, the following information is displayed for each upload:

  * Progress bar
  * Speed
  * Time remaining
  * Total Size, size remaining
  * Percent complete

Multiple uploads are still possible with older browsers, but each upload must be chosen individually.
